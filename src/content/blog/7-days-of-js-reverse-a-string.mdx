Welcome to day 4 of 7 Days of JavaScript!

Today we will see how to reverse a string. It's probably the most asked question ever on technical interviews.

So the statement is quite simple, although the problem has an unexpected complexity when you face it for the first time: write a function that takes a string and returns the string reversed.

Here's an example:

```javascript
reverseString('Japan')
...
'napaJ'
```

Give it a try.
