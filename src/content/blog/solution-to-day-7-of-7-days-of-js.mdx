import Schema from "src/content/schema.astro";

When writing this solution, I realized that I needed a function that returns `true` if a number is prime. So I wrote that function first:

```javascript
function isPrime(n)\{
  let i = 2, rem = true;
  while (i < n && rem)\{
    rem = rem && n % i != 0;
    i++;
  }
  return rem;
}

console.log(isPrime(17))
```

And once I had that, I was ready to write primesUntil, which you can see here:

```javascript
function primesUntil(n)\{
  let x = 1, i = 0;
  while(i < n)\{
    x++;
    if (isPrime(x))\{
      console.log(x);
      i++;
    }
  }
  return 'Those are the first ' + n + ' primes.'
}

console.log(primesUntil(5))
```

It's possible to write both functions with for loops instead of while loops. If you are just starting out with loops in JavaScript, you should try to do that.
