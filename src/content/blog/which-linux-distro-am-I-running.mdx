Once I was a Linux Newbie too, and I struggled my self to answer such a frivolous question, so here I have put all these lines of code together, so you won't need to open 7 tabs and try to figure out which one has the key to get that coveted knowledge. These are many methods, so I can asure you that at least one will work on your PC.

Let's jump right into the code:

```
hostnamectl
```

```
gcc --version
```

```
uname -a
```

```
lsb_release -a
```

```
lsb_release -irc
```

```
lsb_release -ds
```

```
cat /etc/issue*
```

```
cat /proc/version
```

```
cat /etc/*-release
```
